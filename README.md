## Introduction 

This repo contains 2 python programs that use `Visual Recognition with IBM Watson - Image Classification` in a simple example under the supervision of DR.ALaa.
The two programs are in the following files:`watson_OCR.py` and `watson_classifier.py`

## Requiremnets for both programs

1-make sure you have **python** installed on you device
2-IBM Bluemix Account (free) -  https://console.ng.bluemix.net/
3-watson_developer_cloud module python module


## How it works 

1- Once registered, login to your account, go to Services -> Watson and create a Visual Recognition instance  
2- Once you have your VR instance created, you will use its API credentials in your python code

## for the first program

This programe takes an image and through `Visual Recognition with IBM Watson - Image Classification` tells you what is in the image and then redirects you to a Wikipedia article related to the topic of the image.

1- run the `watson_classifier.py` through **IDLE**

2- You can pick the image of your choice by replacing the images_url value with the url of your desired image 

## for the second program 

This program takes an image with text and through `Visual Recognition with IBM Watson - OCR` extracts the text and print it

 1- run the `watson_OCR.py` through **IDLE**
 2-You can pick the image of your choice by replacing the images_url value with the url of your desired image  
 
## Run it throught CMD 

open the file on your `CMD` and then type `watson_OCR.py` or `watson_classifier.py`
